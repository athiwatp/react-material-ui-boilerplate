# React Redux + Material UI

## Run the app

0. ```npm install```
1. ```npm run start```

Once running, if you want to hide the redux dev monitor: ```CTRL+H```

Yes, it takes a while to load the first time you open the app.

### Hot module replacement

Yup! Take a look:

The app updates without the browser having to reload. You don't lose state!

## Build the app
```npm run build```

This will build the app into the "dist" directory in the root of the project. It contains the index.html along with the minified assets, ready for production.

## I don't understand anything!
